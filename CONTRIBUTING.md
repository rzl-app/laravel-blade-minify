# 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

Before creating an issue or submitting a pull request, please read and understand these guidelines.

## 🧭 Etiquette

This project is open source. Maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the code, hoping it helps others.
Please be respectful and considerate — avoid any abuse or frustration towards maintainers.

It’s the maintainer’s duty to ensure that all contributions meet the quality standards needed by the project. Developers have diverse skills, so please respect decisions made on your submissions. Don't be discouraged if your pull request isn’t accepted.

## 💡 Viability

When proposing or submitting a new feature, consider:

- Would this feature also benefit other users?
- Could it add unnecessary complexity?
- Is there a simpler approach?

Open source projects often serve many developers with different needs. Think broadly.

## 🔍 Procedure

Before filing an issue:

- Try to reproduce the problem to ensure it’s valid.
- Check if your suggestion already exists in the project or issues.
- Look at the pull requests to see if someone is already working on it.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Make sure your change or feature doesn’t already exist.
- Check that another PR isn’t already implementing the same idea.

## ✅ Requirements

If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.

- **Follow the [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).**

- **Follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/) — to avoid breaking public APIs without reason.**
